Beanzooka is a tool that allows to launch several sessions of a NetBeans Platform application at the same time. Each session may have its own configuration such as the user dir, the Java runtime and the active plugins.

By launching several sessions of an application, you might be able to:
- compare different versions (i.e. v1.5 vs v1.6)
- compare variations of a workspace
- check plugin behavior on different versions
- check application behavior on different JDKs
- design repeatable scenarios useful for tests, documentation and presentations

See [documentation](https://github.com/nbbrd/beanzooka/wiki).
